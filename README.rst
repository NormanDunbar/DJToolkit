READ ME
=======

This is the new home for the DJToolkit source code. 

The file, ``DJToolkit.asm`` in the ``DJTK_Source\Original`` folder is the old, very old, QDOSMSQ version written with an editor that had hard tabs. All the tabs have been replaced by spaces, but the tabs were asymmetrical, so the code formatting has been bolloxed. (Technical term!)

The file ``DJToolkit.asm`` that can be found in the ``DJTK_Source`` folder, is the new improved version that has been reformatted to something resembling a decent readable format. See the docs under Coding Style for details.

The formatter utility, ``DJTKReformat`` can be found in the ``Tools`` folder, and was compiled with Borland/Embarcadero C++ version 10.1 - which you can get for free, legally. See the docs for details.

If you decide to change the code, please stick to the coding style detailed in the docs. Ta.


Cheers,
Norm.
